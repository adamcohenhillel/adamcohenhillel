      I'm a builder, since forever.
      I built apps and games that were used by millions of people.
      I founded companies and built 100+ products, some succeeded, some didn't. My skillset and interests are very diverse, from games and apps to cybersecurity, hardware, and AI. I also like to read and write a lot (see below).

      <ul>
        <li>I started building websites when I was 8, but no one took me seriously, so I built my own websites (and eventually apps) for myself, which then lead to building one of the first and biggest mobile games company in Israel, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Gruchka&hl=en_US">Gruchka Games</a> (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/abraham-cohen-hillel/id1124164854">iOS</a>) - with more than 1.5M downloads and 150k MAU.</li>
        <li>I then joined the one of the top cyber units of the IDF (unit 81), as a system, then software and security engineer. Which forged me to be able to set up a whole server room from scratch and obvs to write good code! (you can read about funny shitty code I wrote as a kid <a href="https://x.com/adamcohenhillel/status/1625891547412586497">here</a>)</li>
        <li>After my military service I moved to London and joined <a href="https://www.cadosecurity.com/">Cado Security</a> as its first employee and founding engineer, and grew with the company through series Seed, A, and B. Led the software engineering team of ~6 engineers.</li>
        <!-- <li><a href="https://github.com/adamcohenhillel/ADeus">Adeus</a>: the first open source AI Wearable device (<a href="https://x.com/adamcohenhillel/status/1753435031102476701">announcement</a>), which lead to the <a href="https://www.omi.me/"></a>Based Hardware Omi / Friend Company</a>, to which I'm an advisor board member.</li> -->
        <li>Founded Deepen, an AI companion app that became the #1 Product of the Day on Product Hunt, and was downloaded 20k times. Couldn't grow ir further though, and broke up with co-founder.</li>
        <li>Then I moved to San Francisco, and built a bunch of AI x Hardware products, including <a href="https://www.privsov.com/products/ark">The Ark</a> and <a href="https://github.com/adamcohenhillel/ADeus">Adeus</a>, the first open source AI Wearable device (<a href="https://x.com/adamcohenhillel/status/1753435031102476701">announcement</a>), which lead to the <a href="https://www.omi.me/">Based Hardware Omi / Friend Company</a>, to which I'm an advisor board member.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Today I'm building <a href="https://sightbear.com">SightBear</a>, an offensive AI Security Engineer that autonomously finds and exploits web + web3 vulnerabilities.

      <h3>Opinions of mine people don't often agree with:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Privacy is becoming one of the most scarce resources on the planet, which poses a great market opportunity - as people will eventually sober up from the techno-utopian bullshit and realize that privacy is a must</li>
        <li>Open Source is the future of democracy. Voting is not really working for the masses. In the age of AI, AGI, ASI or whatever you want to call it - open source will be the way we the people can collab and "vote"</li>
        <li>Beers are good for productivity, same as coffee. Someone who don't drink coffee if defo less productive</li>
