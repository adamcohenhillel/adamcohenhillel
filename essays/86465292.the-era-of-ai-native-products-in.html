      <hr />
      <p>
        When OpenAI opened their
        <a href="https://beta.openai.com/overview">GPT-3 API</a> for
        <a href="https://openai.com/blog/api-no-waitlist/">free registration</a
        >, it was the first shot fired in what would become known as the
        AI-Native Products trend. This is when The AI Ship left academia and
        landed on the shore of the Builders, Entrepreneurs, and Investors. Why
        is it so important? Because now it scales. Millions of Builders will
        think, innovate, build, try, and fail, rather than hundreds or thousands
        of academia personal and their inner circles. In today’s blog, I will
        outline my view of the upcoming trend in the tech consumption industry,
        called “AI-Native Products”, and where I think it is worth putting the
        focus on as a Builder and where it is NOT.

      <h4>
        <strong>First,</strong>
        <strong>What I mean By “Tech Consumption”:</strong>
      </h4>
      <p>
        Tech Consumption is a name of a
        <strong>technology that has become mainstream</strong> and accessible
        for the average Joe (and widely used in B2C products). Great examples
        are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            1970s/1980s - Computers become mainstream with the Personal
            Computers (PC) Revolution.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            1990s - The Internet adoption in the American household (and web 1.0
            protocols).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>2000s - When everyone opened a Facebook account.</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>
            2010s - The Mobile Era, when people got themselves Multitouch
            smartphones.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>There are, of course, so many more examples, but you get the point.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h4>So What Are These “AI-Native Products”?</h4>
      <p>
        Some of these “products” have already shifted to the mainstream, with
        <a href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2/">DALL-E</a>, which generates
        images based on a given prompt (e.g., the blog’s picture), or
        <a href="https://openai.com/api/">GPT-3</a>, which generates text. These
        two “AI models” received extensive news coverage both on traditional and
        social media. However,
        <strong
          >this is not the trend I am referring to; this is what enables
          it.</strong
        >
        Let me explain:
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though these models can generate value for certain people, they are
        not consumer products. They are too generalised and don't solve a
        specific problem for a customer. However, these models can be leveraged
        to create a product on top of them that does solve a problem. They are
        more like the "Infrastructure" of the true AI-Native Products era we are
        entering (let's call them “<strong>Infra-Models</strong>” from now.)
        They will play a crucial role in it - just like the innovative startups
        of the 2010s were leveraging the GPS, smartphones and App Stores to
        create unique valuable products that solved an actual problem for the
        consumer.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the media is going crazy about the Infra-Models as they are, the
        era of the AI-Native product is forming in smaller groups on Twitter and
        Discord. Indie-Entrepreneurs and a small group of friends are trying to
        team up and build something new. I like to think about this stage as the
        equivalent of a bunch of guys in their garage building the first PC. It
        is still the trend's early stages, but this is precisely when new giants
        are forming.<br /><br />Read more @

      </p>
      <p></p>
      <h4><strong>What it will NOT look like:</strong></h4>
      <p>
        I’m already seeing three “sub-trends” in my circle on Twitter (check out
        who I am following on Twitter @adamcohenhillel), these trends might
        overlap, but their overall concept is wrong:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Copy the old:</strong> In the short term, companies will build
        products that imitate pre-AI companies with the AI twist. This might
        work, but it most likely won’t be the place of real innovation. Think of
        it in comparison to the Dotcom Era, when newspapers and magazines
        created websites that copied their offline presence without taking
        advantage of the new opportunities offered by the internet. In contrast,
        new companies that did take advantage of those opportunities thrived.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><p>Twitter - Everyone becomes a journalist now.</p></li>
        <li><p>Amazon - Why do we need to hold stock on the internet?</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Uber - Let’s use the interconnectivity of GPS and mobile to fight
            the 2008 crisis.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Netflix - Started by copying the “Old” DVD model online but
            eventually shifted to the new era with the streaming service.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>Straightforward 1x innovation: </strong>Straightforward
        innovation using Infra-Models is currently trendy and dominating the
        industry. However, this is likely to be a short-lived trend. Companies
        that use Infra-Models to create products such as “generate your profile
        picture” or “write-assistant” may have some success but are not
        genuinely creating significant enough new value to sustain. To be
        innovative, you should think about how you can leverage the
        already-possible capabilities of the Infra-Models to perform a new type
        of functionality rather than warping it in a nice-looking way.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>AI-Focused Consumer Products:</strong> Companies that focus on
        “AI” in their value proposition should be careful, as this trend is
        missing the point. AI-Native <strong>enables</strong> a new type of
        great products; it is not the core product itself. No one who’s using
        Uber cares about the underlying technology; they care about what the
        product enables them to do.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <h4>So what will it look like?</h4>
      <p>
        This question can be rephrased as “What might be possible now that
        wasn’t possible before?” And to answer that, we need to understand what
        these Infra-Models are doing and what they’re capable of:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Understanding Human Language:</strong> One of the most amazing
        “byproduct” of generative models like GPT-3 is that they also
        “understand” human language. And by that, I only mean that it knows how
        to get text input and generate a great output based on it. This
        generative process can be seen as “understanding”. Now my point is the
        “generative” nature of the model doesn’t have to be the focus of a new
        product, but that “understanding” byproduct. (see list below).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Data manipulation: </strong>This as well, is a byproduct of the
        generative nature of the infra-models. Unuseful input A → to get back
        useful output B that can be used in the program. We are not taking the
        generated output as the goal itself but using it to manipulate data and
        form new structures and acting decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Generating: </strong>Don’t get me wrong, the generative nature
        of these models is impressive, and there are so many things to build on
        top of that. Copilot and similar products are great, valuable and
        innovative. They will soon be used in similar products for other areas
        of human knowledge, like Law, Sales, to even gaming companies that can
        now generate worlds and quests at scale.
      </p>
      <p>So, think about areas today that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Have a communication issue. </strong>Today, we already see
            tools that “summarise” content,
            <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/scispace"
              >making it clearer for the reader</a
            >
            to digest. However, content consumption is only one way of
            communication; this model can be replicated in other places.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Require Human Reasoning.</strong> Chatbots are an
            interesting example, as they require reasoning on the user’s prompt.
            But they are too simple for what I actually mean here. A better
            example might be Twitter, which can now leverage “reasoning” on its
            users’ tweets to create a different experience.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Depends on Human Automation.</strong> Copilot to everything.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Can benefit from new data at scale</strong>. Gaming
            companies, Netflix, and other content-consumption products can
            create content in a fast, personalised way.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is very vague and only outlines a small percentage of what will
        actually be built soon. But again, to summarise the idea: these
        AI-Native capabilities are <strong>the backend</strong> of the new
        products, and consumers won’t care about them if it doesn’t truly enable
        a new capability for the mind. As a gamer, I don’t care if an AI
        generated this new map, but I would care about a game with an endless
        map. Do you get the point? Do you see the difference?
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <h4><strong>The Formation of a Bubble:</strong></h4>
      <p>
        We should be cautious not to create another Bubble. This is a request
        for both entrepreneurs and investors. Find a real problem worth solving,
        don’t get hooked by the hype of the “cool” technology, and don’t get
        excited by huge funding rounds. It is not how much money you can
        accumulate from investors but how much value you can give your
        customers. Try to create a REAL value.<br />
      </p>
      <h4>Conclusion, Beyond the Bubble:</h4>
      <p>
        A new era starts with the enthusiasm of single entrepreneurs who see
        ways to leverage new technology to create value. A bunch of companies
        spring up, some succeed, and some fail. New consumer standards will
        emerge, and eventually, we will see new tech giants alongside the old
        ones. These giants will be “AI-Native”, which means that in their core
        backend, their innovation is only possible because of the large AI
        models we call "Infra-Models."
      </p>
      <p>
        Along this trend, OpenAI (as the pioneer) and other “Infrastructure”
        companies will rise to a giant dimension - as they are the ones who
        enable this era of innovation (Just like Apple enabled the Mobile age).
        Will these infrastructure companies to consumer products as well? I
        think so.
