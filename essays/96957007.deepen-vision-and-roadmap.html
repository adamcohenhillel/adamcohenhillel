<p>
    The well-known philosopher Socrates famously stated, "know yourself," when
    asked to sum up the essence of all philosophical principles. Behind these
    simple words lies a great idea - that self-awareness is the foundation of
    wisdom and virtue. Socrates believed that by understanding oneself, one could
    understand their limitations and make more informed decisions. The way there
    is through self-reflection and introspection, by examining one's thoughts and
    actions.
  </p>
  <p>
    For centuries, journaling has been a powerful tool for self-reflection and
    understanding. However, with the emergence of modern psychology in the 20th
    century, new methods and techniques were introduced to gain insight into human
    behaviour and emotions. Pioneers like Freud and his techniques of free
    association and talk therapy significantly advanced the field of psychology as
    we know it today and shaped our understanding of the human mind.<br />
  </p>
  <h4>So what IS <strong>Deepen</strong>?</h4>
  <p>
    The vision for “Deepen” will be the next phase of this ongoing transition - a
    tool for one to explore and interact with their Self in a way that was not
    possible before. I’ve written at length about Generative AI in the past, and
    it will be the building block that will enable Deepen.
  </p>
  <p>
    By leveraging the Large Language Models under the hood, Deepen will provide an
    interface to write your thoughts/journal (and later on, also import data from
    different places), so you can (literally) interact with your Self. You could
    ask yourself questions, see insights from the data across time, track your
    mood and experiences more systematically, see what affects your mental state,
    and more.
  </p>
  <p>
    Imagine being able to travel back in time, to any day from the past three
    years, and have a conversation with your past self. With Deepen, this will be
    a reality. By swiping to any given day since you started using the platform,
    it will build a chatbot tailored made for you (based on your data), so you can
    ask your old self questions, gain new insights into the path you chose in the
    past, and maybe even go through the process of self-healing by gaining
    compassion for the person you used to be.

  <h4>Roadmap - What’s ahead?</h4>
  <p><strong>The Near-Future Features → Current Focus:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        This month, we will release the platform's first version, which will
        include an essential functionality for Beta users, as follow :
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><p>An interface to journal daily thoughts</p></li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Automatic analysis using Gen-AIs to produce different metrics (like
            emotions, such as “depression” and “excitement”) and extract data
            points (like activities, people, etc.) to build a connection graph →
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            A dashboard to see the analysed (think about it as an emotions tracker
            app dashboard, just way better and with much less effort).
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Then, over February, we will work closely with the Beta users to fix bugs
        and change the UI/UX based on the feedback to make the platform stable for
        open registration.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Then, we will introduce a more interactive interface to the user’s data -
        being able to “chat” with themselves, ask questions, and perform a
        semantic search.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Lastly, we will add the option to import data from (or connect to)
        Google/Notes/Notion - to enrich the platform’s capabilities and
        understanding.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        ? Free-association interactive journaling (Freud 2.0) → making a
        gamification journaling interface to foster free-association.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>At this stage, I’m hoping to have some feature requests from users!</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p></p>
  <h4>Farer Vision - Where Can This Go?</h4>
  <p>
    <strong>Idea: Facing Outwards:</strong><br />The first stage (as described
    above) focuses on individuals interacting with and strengthening their
    understanding of themselves. This stage, however, is about effectively
    communicating that understanding to others. A simple feature like the ability
    to "Export to a therapist" will fall under here. Think about it; it can reduce
    the learning curve of one’s history and make the transition to a new therapist
    much easier. The same can be expanded to help communicate within relationships
    and express feelings. No longer will the question "Why are you like this?" be
    necessary, instead you could share parts of your Deepen ;) (I am only half
    kidding. And yes, I do know there is a Black Mirror episode about it)
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Idea: A New Type of Business Model<br /></strong>This is when I start
    losing people in my explanation of the vision. Still, it is such a fascinating
    idea to explore that it is worth mentioning now briefly, but I will explore it
    in more detail in one of my next articles. Bear with me - Deepen can be the
    foundation for a new <strong>business model</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    By introducing a new way of measuring mental state, we can start applying
    measures of success to certain goods that were much more difficult to achieve
    before. For example, in therapy, imagine being able to measure its success
    over time. And then imagine a therapist who’s willing to invest in your
    current “low” value in return for a future value increase → this can create a
    kind of exchange where consumers can exchange their current “social
    token”/”mental state” value in return for goods, which then later the
    goods-provider will be able to cash-out with profit (if its service was good).
  </p>
  <p>
    But Why? Well, the current business models companies use, such as
    one-time-cost, subscriptions, pay-as-you-go, or "entirely free," all have
    flaws, one of which is the lack of alignment between the goods provider (the
    company) and the consumer. Think about Meta (Facebook); they have no
    direct/true interest in providing the best product or service to the consumer
    because it will almost always mean compromising on profit. SAME FOR THERAPY.
  </p>
  <p>
    If companies’ way of increasing profits aligned with the customer’s interests,
    the world would be a much better place. Deepen might enable such a thing in
    the future.

  <h4>A Funny Story before You go:</h4>
  <p>
    A few months ago, during a therapy session, I was reflecting on a significant
    period in my life. With hindsight, I could see how it had affected me, even
    today. During the session, I confidently shared different aspects of the
    story, and at the end of the session, the therapist asked me to try to
    remember more details in preparation for our next session. <br />So, being the
    engineer that I am, during that night, I took out my phone and began
    scrolling, for hours, through old WhatsApp chats, creating a timeline,
    connecting the dots between different people, and even checking my Camera Roll
    (I've had an iPhone for many years) to understand where I was and what I did
    in specific days back then. Ultimately, I realised that the story I had been
    telling myself for years was completely incorrect. It was shocking at first,
    as I was pretty confident about the story, which shaped my thinking, but
    eventually, it helped me see the story from a whole new perspective, which I
    needed. Imagine if I could send my old self, “Yo, Adam, what have you done?”
