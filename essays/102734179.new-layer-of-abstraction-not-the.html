    <p style="color: gray; font-weight: normal;">An optimistic view on how Software Engineering will progress in the upcoming years</p>

<p>
    In the last few months, I had a couple of discussions with different software
    engineers about the future of our profession. As an AI-enthusiastic, I was
    trying to be the optimistic voice between the pessimistic/ignorant views
    surrounding that topic. In this article, I will share my perspective on how I
    see our field progress, my arguments for it, and where I think you should
    focus as a software engineer in this changing world.

  <h4>TL;DR</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        AI will not replace but enhance software developers to be more productive
        and to create products that
        <a href="https://aigrant.org/">weren’t possible in the past.</a>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Boost in productivity occurred many times in the past - at higher rates
        than we currently see with AI tools—E.g. with high-level programming
        languages, the shift to the cloud, open source culture, etc.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The barrier to writing code will be reduced, and more people will enter
        the arena.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        All of the above is a positive trend as it will boost the industry, not
        the other way around. It will lead to a new era of growth, products and
        opportunities for all.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        To be part of it, you do need to be active, keep updating your skills, and
        embrace new tools.

  <h4>Let’s GO:</h4>
  <p>
    It is crucial to begin by acknowledging that the recent boom of AI tools, such
    as Copilot by Github, Codex by OpenAI, and ChatGPT by OpenAI - have shown us
    very clearly, that they are capable of enhancing software engineers. Not the
    <strong>potential</strong> to, but the
    <strong>already-here</strong> usefulness. I'm using ChatGPT daily, and it
    almost entirely replaced my Stackoverflow-usage. I write code for around ~8
    hours a day, including weekends (for work and personal projects), and I’m
    saving about ~5 hours a week thanks to it (<a

    For this argument, I’d refer to the much-beloved <em>Pareto principle </em>-
    or 80/20 Rule - which states that 80% of the deliverable from a project is
    achieved with 20% of the effort and that the remaining 20% will require 80% of
    the effort. In our scenario, this can be thought of in two ways:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        The remaining “20%” for Copilot/ChatGPT to automate software engineers
        entirely will be the difficult 80% effort. Which means we still have a
        long way to go. This will be the reasoning, debugging, and the “connecting
        the dots” of different parts of the codes in a codebase (and less about
        the specific known algorithms, tests, etc).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Copilot automates the 80% “copy-paste” job of engineering, where we, the
        engineers, are left with closing up the remaining 20% - Yay! (More about
        it later)

    Another way of looking at these tools is in the context of previous
    technological advances in our field. For example, Github argues that engineers
    using their Copilot are
    <a
      href="https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/#:~:text=The%20group%20that%20used%20GitHub,didn't%20use%20GitHub%20Copilot."
      >55% more productive/fast</a
    >
    in completing a specific set of tasks (note that this might not be fair
    research as the tasks might’ve been part of the model’s training dataset).
    This sounds like a crazy increase in productivity (and it is), but also not
    something we haven’t seen before. In the 1960s, with the introduction of
    High-Level programming languages, we saw
    <a href="http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/prechelt/Biblio//jccpprtTR.pdf"
      >more or less the same boost in productivit</a
    >y of engineers writing code in High-level languages compared to low-level
    languages.

    A different concern I’ve heard is that this will make more people go to
    software, as it will be more accessible, making it much more difficult to find
    a job, make a living, etc. More people will indeed do software, as it will
    (and already is) reduce the barrier to becoming a software engineer. But it
    also opens up a new frontier of potential products, opportunities, and
    economic growth (As mentioned in my previous articles
    <a
      href="https://adamcohenhillel.substack.com/p/how-generative-ai-will-change-the"
      >here</a

    <a

    Just like when the PC, the Internet, the mobile, and the cloud were introduced
    and were available for more people, it didn’t make people absolute, but it
    created so many new opportunities in the form of

    It is important to note that we won't be doing what we currently do in 5
    years, which is okay. This is what this industry has been doing from day 1 -
    creating <strong>more and more layers of abstractions</strong> to enable us to
    <strong>focus on what matters - building stuff</strong>. For example, you
    don’t need to write your own authentication system nowadays. Thanks to
    companies like Google (Firebase), AWS (Cognito), etc., you can do that in 10
    lines of code. Same with the cloud, you don’t need to care much for the
    scaling of your app, but AWS/Azure/GCP give you many different tools that
    enable you to scale stuff for millions of users effortlessly. In the past (~10
    years ago), you needed to run your own server on your own hardware - you know
    how difficult it was? Thanks for not having to do that - we’ve experienced the
    boom of the 2010s with the mobile revolution. AI is another layer of
    abstraction that will enable you to focus on the business itself, building
    products faster and better.

    Sam (OpenAI CEO) is a bit dystopian for the individual, but remember, he is
    the merchant trying to make his commodities worth more. The way we will write
    software in the future is somewhere in the middle. We will all have an AI
    assistant, some sort of ChatGPT, where it will be back-and-forth of English to
    code to English. We will be guiding it, and it will be guiding us back to the
    code. We will need to understand the code it generates and tweak it for the
    specific app. We will need to understand, at least conceptually, different
    algorithms and underlying computer science thinking (at a much higher level
    than today’s CS students, though) to be able to read and approve code (and
    mainly tests), and to “get under the bonnet” when needed. We will write more
    application code, connecting different interfaces (like using a 3rd party
    library or an API today) to form the required business logic. Understanding
    the code will be needed to do this reliably and at scale. You, as an engineer,
    will be able to do more stuff by supervising and guiding the tool and jumping
    in where needed. Think about yourself as a lead/senior engineer working with 5
    junior engineers - this will be more like that than “give me an app that does
    X Y X” and that is it.
  </p>
  <h4>
    <strong><br />So, what should you do today?</strong>
  </h4>
  <p>
    All of the optimism above does not come just about, and you will need to be
    ready to be flexible, to learn, and to adjust. I am far from being an expert,
    but here are my recommendations on how to best face the changing world:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Start using these tools.</strong> I was surprised to hear how many
    engineers read about Copilot but have yet actually tried to leverage it. This
    will <strong>already</strong> boost your productivity and will enable you to
    do more. Not using those tools is like trying to implement your authentication
    system or run on your own server home at for production - you can, but why
    would you? Focus on the important stuff.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Be up-to-date with what is going on</strong>. That means reading
    articles (like this and many others). Follow and engage with relevant people
    on Twitter (from big names like the ones I embedded in this article to smaller
    ones like myself and many others). Being part of these discussions will help
    you form your perspective on the subject and to be in a better place in the
    changing world.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Learn &amp; Build - Don’t be stuck with your current stack</strong>
    (whoop a rhyme!), keep learning new technologies that are released, learn
    about ML/AI/LLMs, build small projects and share them online, and be involved
    in the Open source community.
  </p>

        For software developers without a background in machine learning, I will
        recommend watching Andrej's playlist here:

      </p>
    </li>

        Reach out to me here or on Twitter and I’d be happy to share more
        resources and topics to learn!
