      <p>
        If there is one feeling I am most comfortable with, and which I remember
        and know most closely since I was a kid, it is loneliness. Not always
        with its negative connotations, but as a natural feeling, a constant
        state of solitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        This feeling almost has a smell and a taste in my mind as I think about
        my past. I remember being alone in my room, doing my own thing,
        exploring my thoughts. How I was not understood by others, from my
        actions to my thoughts. From having different wants and needs compared
        to my peers, to the way I expressed myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was loved, I was hugged, and I was around great people and family. I
        felt happiness and I laughed. I felt closeness and warmth. And yet, my
        existence in this world was always accompanied by a slight feeling of
        loneliness.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I appreciate this feeling, as it made me human. Loneliness brought
        me my closest friends and most meaningful experiences. It introduced me
        to the depths of knowledge in the world, and gifted me with the
        curiosity to explore it. It drove and drives me to build, to chase, to
        try. It made me seek love, and to try again and again, regardless of the
        pain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Loneliness might not be the right word to describe what I am trying to
        convey, nor is solitude sufficient. But what I argue is that this
        “thing” is at the core of our free will, and the base of our
        civilization. And I will try to elaborate.

        Loneliness is the essence of the human experience—it is what made our
        civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
        You strive to construct a world around yourself— you seek connections
        and belonging through relationships, family, and friendships. You pursue
        love, spirituality, curiosity, and passions from the arts to science.
        You read, create art, write poems, compose music, and tell stories.
      </p>
      <p>
        And our world as a whole, built by many humans, is not different.
        Institutions—old and new—are created to impose meaning on our lonely
        existence on this big, floating rock. God and religion, countries,
        nations, and governments.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you go outside, or even explore your own mind—all you see is an
        endless effort to fight our lonely existence, both as individuals and as
        a species.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"It is not good for man to be alone"</em> (Genesis 2:18)<br /><em
          >...Thus, he builds a world around him.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Just because I deeply know loneliness, I am using all my energy to
        escape it.
