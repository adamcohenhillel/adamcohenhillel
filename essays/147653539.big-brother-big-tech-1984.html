        The world we’re living in is slowly changing right before our eyes—not
        hidden, not apologized for, but portrayed as a favor to us, the people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cameras recording every move, data aggregated at every click, social
        media monitored, bots and algorithms subtly steering our thoughts,
        shaping our so-called “free” will. Psyops at every corner, fighters
        criticized, canceled.

        At the dawn of the Information Age, visionaries saw cyberspace as the
        arena where we would finally transcend the physical limitations that had
        long shackled us. It was supposed to be our sanctuary, our escape, our
        new frontier.
      </p>
      <p>
        But as the 2000s unfolded, it became clear that the powers weren’t
        willing to surrender without a fight. They built efficient cyber teams,
        recruiting our best hackers. They installed cameras for our safety and
        monitored our phones for our own good. They sold our data and made a
        fortune. And with that fortune, they expanded their control, tightening
        their grip on the very freedoms we once had.
      </p>
      <p>—</p>
      <p>
        But, as in every good old American movie, we had heroes. Along the way,
        a few pioneers—true visionaries—saw what was happening and fought back.
        Thanks to them, we’re in a much better place than we could have been.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the US Founding Fathers, who insisted on privacy in the Bill of
        Rights, to Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, who pioneered public-key
        cryptography despite resistance from governments; from Tim Berners-Lee,
        who invented the World Wide Web and kept it open, to Phil Zimmermann,
        who faced government scrutiny when he created PGP encryption to protect
        our emails; from Linus Torvalds, who gave us Linux, to Satoshi Nakamoto,
        who introduced blockchain and Bitcoin, challenging centralized power.

          temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.”</em
        >
        — Benjamin Franklin
      </p>
      <p>—</p>
      <p><strong>This is our turn now—what can we build?</strong></p>
      <p>
        <strong>Counter-Surveillance:</strong> Privacy is essential for true
        freedom. Constant monitoring and tracking can erode our personal
        autonomy. We must actively address these concerns to protect our right
        to privacy and ensure that surveillance does not compromise our
        freedoms.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Free Speech / Free Will / Psyops:</strong> True freedom and free
        will are at risk when we're manipulated, whether by targeted agendas or
        dopamine-driven addiction. Social media’s black box algorithms, which
        obscure how they influence what we see, can subtly shape our thoughts.
        We need to counter that trend, and reclaim our minds..
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Education:</strong> The people—our fellow citizens—don’t care
        enough. They don’t understand the stakes. They don’t realize their
        Windows can be remotely controlled, their thoughts influenced without
        their consent. We must educate, put the information and the tools out
        there. We need to empower people to take action.
