    <h1>Countering "The Coming Wave" by Mustafa Suleyman: The Case for Open Source AI</h1>
    <p style="color: gray; font-weight: normal;">It is we who will be affected, hence it is we who are in-charge</p>
    <p style="color: gray; font-weight: normal;">By Adam Cohen Hillel, originally published on <a href="https://essays.adamcohenhillel.com/p/countering-the-coming-wave-by-mustafa">Substack, Nov 01, 2023</a></p>
    <hr>
    
    
<p>
    I’ve read the book “The Coming Wave” by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Suleyman">Mustafa Suleyman</a>,
    the Co-Founder of <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/">DeepMind</a> and
    <a href="https://inflection.ai/">Inflection AI</a>, a legendary entrepreneur
    in the space of AI. Unfortunately, though, his view on the upcoming “wave” of
    technological revolution is devastating for the people and the values of
    modern society. His arguments of how we must handle the dangerous aspects of
    these new technologies are lacking and dangerous if they will be followed.
    Democracy, Self-Sovereignty, and everything we stand for as a modern society
    are at stake here.
  </p>
  <p>
    In short, Mustafa claims that the upcoming technologies of the next few years
    (mainly in the space of Artificial Intelligence and Biotech) will be so
    fundamentally disrupting that we must change the way we allow and conduct
    innovation, scientific discoveries, and knowledge sharing - all in order to
    contain the danger these technologies will bring. The book is an ongoing case
    for why we should do that, how this wave is different from previous
    technological changes, and eventually finish with what we must do to be safe
    and for civilization to continue.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this essay, I hope to debunk the holes in his ideas and show why they’re
    problematic; we will talk about:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Why nation-states are not our strong pillars</p></li>
    <li><p>How the well-funded companies use regulation as a moat</p></li>
    <li><p>The upcoming unipolar AGI scenario</p></li>
    <li><p>Unwanted side-effects of regulation on individuals</p></li>
    <li><p>The issue with AI-safety research on out-of-reach black box</p></li>
    <li><p>Why closed-source security is not superior to open-source</p></li>
    <li><p>The biased progress in AI alignment</p></li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Then, I will suggest an alternative approach for moving forward in these
    changing times. Let’s get started!

  <h4>Wrong Starting Point: Why Nation-States Are Not Our Strong Pillars</h4>
  <p>
    Before we dive into the more technical holes of Mustafa’s ideas, I want to
    briefly refer to the most fundamental building block of his solution argument:
    the nation-state.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mustafa uses the nation-state as the de facto tool for world cooperation and
    world governance to fight and save us from AI that goes rogue from
    civilization’s best interests.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, I disagree with the underlying assumptions here that nation-states
    have the public’s best interests in mind. In today’s Western world,
    democracies are more polarized than ever. Trust in institutions and leaders is
    at a low point, while corruption is at a high point worldwide.

    goes on and on. But unlike Mustafa’s claims that “as an equal partner in the

    the last few years to realize how corrupted the world is.

    Suppose this technological revolution is as big as Mustafa suggests- a
    breaking point from which there is no going back, a powerful tool that puts
    everything we know in danger. In that case, governments are not the ones to
    handle it, at least not in their current structure; they just don’t have the
    moral mandate to make AI-related crucial decisions on our behalf. Accumulating
    such power in the hands of the few won’t end well.
  </p>
  <div class="pullquote">
    <p>
      <strong
        >If the stakes are as high as Mustafa claims them to be - then the
        nation-state mustn’t be making these decisions for our entire
        civilization.</strong
      >
    </p>
  </div>
  <h4>How Well-Funded Companies Use Regulation as a Moat</h4>
  <p>
    Throughout the book, Mustafa tells us stories about how previous regulations
    worked amazingly. From the nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the FAA
    (Federal Aviation Administration), the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), and
    a few more examples. He uses these examples to make his later suggestion land
    better: a license-based regulation for AI companies:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “Today, anyone can build AI. Anyone can set up a lab. We should instead move
      to a more licensed environment. […] so you shouldn’t simply be able to
      release a state-of-the-art AI,” Mustafa Suleyman
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now, there are two terms here I want you to understand:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        “moat,” which, in the context of businesses and companies, means
        <strong
          >a company’s ability to maintain competitive advantages over its
          competitors to protect its long-term profits and market share from
          competing firms.</strong
        >
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        “regulatory capture” - a situation in which a government agency that was
        meant to regulate an industry becomes too influenced by that industry,
        undermining its ability to protect the public interest effectively and
        ending up serving the interests of the industry itself (and the big
        players in that industry in particular).
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture"
      >Regulatory capture</a
    >
    is already being used as a moat by many industries. Companies are actively
    trying to leverage and manipulate regulations and policymakers. Special
    interests are shaping policy for their own benefit, stifling competition,
    raising prices, and inhibiting innovation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following talk by Bill Gurley is a great explanation of how companies
    throughout the years have done exactly that. Bill explains this better than I
    ever can, so I highly recommend you watch it. But, if we fetch just one
    example from the video, it will be
    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Telecommunications-Act"
      >The Telecommunications Act of 1996</a
    >. This was a US legislation that attempted to bring more competition to the
    telephone market for both local and long-distance services. However, the
    result was that over 20 states essentially outlawed cities from providing free
    public WiFi due to telecom giants like Verizon and Comcast, who lobbied state
    legislatures to pass bills banning municipal broadband, protecting their own
    commercial interests rather than serving citizens.

  <h4>The Upcoming Unipolar AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) Scenario</h4>
  <p>
    Another issue with regulation is its outcome. Whether you agree that an AGI
    (Artificial General Intelligence) is on the horizon or not, what matters for
    the sake of this argument is that the people who are leading the big AI
    companies <em><strong>do</strong></em> believe (or claim to believe) it is
    coming. From the book’s author, Mustafa, to OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Elon Musk,
    and others.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, there is a common discussion among AI researchers about what happens
    <em><strong>when</strong> </em>we achieve AGI - is it better to have one AGI
    (known as the Unipolar AGI scenario) - so we can more centrally control it, or
    are we better off having a few (Multipolar AGI scenario) - so that the power
    will be balanced and distributed?
  </p>
  <p>
    Suppose you are like me, believing in democracy and the idea of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers"
      >Separation of Power</a
    >
    - then, obviously, the multipolar scenario sounds better. But, there are
    varied arguments for either approach, with
    <a
      href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gAwR8PkZ6fvayXEdK/a-newcomer-s-guide-to-the-technical-ai-safety-field"
      >some philosophical research and discussions</a
    >
    being done in that space, with
    <a href="https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1718670073391378694"
      >discussions on Twitter</a
    >, too. Overall, though, the leaders of the AI community believe that the
    multipolar scenario is a favorable outcome for humanity. From OpenAI’s CEO Sam
    Altam, who said that
    <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebjkD1Om4uw&amp;t=1093s&amp;ab_channel=ConnieLoizos"
      >“multiple AGIs in the world I think is better than one,”</a
    >
    to Elon Musk, who said in an interview that
    <a
      href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-musk-xai-openai-competition-develop-superintelligence-artificial-intelligence-2023-7?r=US&amp;IR=T#:~:text=%22You%20don%27t%20want%20to%20have%20a%20unipolar%20world%20where%20one%20company%20dominates%20in%20AI%2C%22"
      >“you don’t want to have a unipolar world where one company dominates in
      AI.”</a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    So we have people who are saying the following three arguments simultaneously:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><p>AGI is coming</p></li>
    <li><p>Having one is bad; having a few separate ones will be better</p></li>
    <li><p>Let’s regulate our industry and create an entrance barrier</p></li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    The issue is that we won’t get a multipolar AGI scenario with a
    well-coordinated, unified world government that regulates and places high
    entrance barriers for AI research and development. They cannot have it both
    ways. They cannot morally claim that we must have a multipolar AGI scenario
    while also restricting actors from participating in this space. It just
    doesn’t work. And as Yann LeCun, Chief AI Scientist at Meta (Facebook), says,
    <a href="https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1718670073391378694"
      >“[It will] *inevitably* result in what you and I would identify as a
      catastrophe: a small number of companies will control AI.”</a
    >
  </p>
  <div class="pullquote">
    <p>
      <strong
        >“AGI is coming” + believing Multipolar AGI is better + Want regulation
        <br />===<br />A broken line of thought.</strong
      >
    </p>
  </div>
  <h4>Unwanted Side-effects of Regulation for Individuals</h4>
  <p>
    Last point regarding the regulation issue:
    <a
      href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/"
      >President Biden's recent Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy
      Artificial Intelligence</a
    >
    shows that they plan to enforce AI safety by limiting the amount of compute
    power (hardware, processors, computers, essentially) you can own and the
    amount of operations you can perform on it ( FLOPS - floating-point operations
    per second).
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, the suggested limit is very high, targeting large companies and
    their enormous datacenters. However, today’s compute power of the best
    supercomputers is tomorrow’s consumers’ level of compute power. The compute
    power that was exclusively delivered by supercomputers will be accessible to
    startups in garages and individuals in the next few years -

    Rolling back regulation after it passed is not an easy task, and it sets a
    <strong>precedent</strong> for further regulations and tightening of the
    restrictions (which, in this case, basically means
    <a href="https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1719185755908817090"
      >limiting math</a
    >).
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, regulations can be used maliciously by the government itself -
    like what happened with the Patriot Act in the US. In the name of fighting
    terrorism after 9/11, the Patriot Act allowed the government and law
    enforcement to perform mass surveillance on citizens - which they actually
    did. The AI act might enable governments to misuse their power in a similar
    way, and much worse: limiting individuals’ privacy (to track who owns what
    hardware), autonomy, and liberty (what you do with your computing power).

  <h4>Why Closed-Source Security is Not Superior to Open-Source</h4>
  <p>
    To show how previous technologies were maliciously used to cause harm, Mustafa
    gave an example from the realm of cybersecurity, a space I’m happy to have
    some knowledge of!
  </p>
  <p>
    He talked about how cyber attacks (in particular,
    <a href="https://www.acronis.com/en-us/blog/posts/nhs-cyber-attack/"
      >WannaCry, a ransomware attack that disabled critical infra in the UK a few
      years ago</a
    >) - showed us that “core institutions of modern life are vulnerable” (I’m
    quoting Mustafa here, yeah?) as “such attacks demonstrate that there are those
    who would use cutting-edge technologies to degrade and disable key state
    functions” and that “lone individual and a private company (Microsoft),” had
    to patch it themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    Essentially, he is referring to the fact that the attackers used a loophole
    (known in the industry as a “vulnerability”) in Microsoft’s software Windows
    (the operating system) to block access to the computers of the UK NHS
    (National Health Service). He said: “If everyone has access to more
    capability, that clearly also includes those who wish to cause harm […]
    Democratizing access means democratizing risk.” - so far so good, isn’t it?
    Well, what he forgot to note is that in the case of Operating Systems, Linux,
    an open-source alternative to Microsoft’s Windows,
    <a
      href="https://web-mind.io/cyber-security/windows-vs-linux-which-is-safer/#:~:text=The%20short%20answer%20is%20yes,access%20to%20users%20by%20default."
      >is much more secure and often patches way quicker</a
    >
    than Windows, and developing such attacks for Linux is much more complex.
  </p>
  <p>
    The reason why Linux is more secure is because everyone has access to the
    underlying code. Therefore, everyone can
    <strong>find and fix</strong> security risks (which are then all publicly
    available). Because of the nature of that software paradigm, there are plenty
    more people in the open-source community who are working on finding and fixing
    these bugs than you have working in Microsoft (across all of the company!).
    They often do it for <strong>free</strong> (for the sake of the community,
    humanity, or just curiosity) - and also through paid bounties (plenty of
    companies have the incentives to find and fix open-source vulnerabilities in
    Linux, as it is used in so many places. In fact, it is usually one of the most
    well-paying bounties, as it is also one of the toughest to find issues in due
    to its hardcore security)
  </p>
  <p>
    The argument is simple: creating models openly leads to a more resilient
    solution that is less prone to harm than closed development, AI safety
    concerns, AI tools, etc. - are not an exception to that rule.

    (Additionally, similar to what we previously talked about regarding special
    interests when it comes to big corporations and the government - it also works
    the other way around. Microsoft is working so closely with the US
    government—one of its largest enterprise customers (if not the largest). It
    wouldn’t be a surprise if the US gov approached Microsoft (or even agreed on a
    formal procedure) to “not” patch publicly undiscovered security risks for some
    time (these are known as 0-day) so the government can use it in the name of
    “national security.” Microsoft has great incentives to follow and not to fix
    some issues - working against the public best interest, as

  <h4>The Issue with AI-Safety Research on Out-of-Reach Black Box</h4>
  <p>
    Another point that Mustafa is making is the need for AI safety research. He
    suggests that the government should make companies dedicate 20% of their
    R&amp;D budget to safety research.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am not ignorant of the potential great risks that AI can pose, from the
    social instability associated with mass labor automation to the age of
    misinformation, the lack of establishing truth online, and even the doomsday
    scenarios of paperclip maximizers. They all have a place in the discussions.
  </p>
  <p>
    To contain these risks, or at least roll them out from feasibility - we need
    to understand these models as best as possible. We need to understand how they
    work, what neural structure is created in them during training, what biases
    and pitfalls are fused to their weights, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong
      >Therefore - I agree with Mustafa that there is room for AI safety research
      and a place for the government to incentivize that.</strong
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong
      >However, I can’t see how we can have effective AI safety research without
      access to the underlying systems.</strong
    >
    Mustafa’s call for safety is within the organization, but
    <strong
      >the best safety research I’ve seen so far came from the community,
      investigating an Open-source Large Language Model called Llama-2!</strong

    and knowledge sharing was and is so fundamental to the flourishing of
    humankind - it’s a way to distribute difficult and complex tasks most
    efficiently. No matter how much money you pour into AI safety research (20%
    like Mustafa suggested and OpenAI committed to) - you cannot get better
    results than the entire AI community worldwide. You just can’t.

  <h4>The Biased Progress in Closed-Source AI Alignment</h4>
  <p>
    Lastly, I want to add context to one of the great achievements in AI alignment
    that Mustafa mentioned in the book - the “<a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback"
      >RLHF</a
    >” technique (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback). This technique
    trains AI models by having humans give feedback on the model’s outputs, which
    the model then uses to improve.
  </p>
  <p>
    However useful it is (it was one of the main improvements in creating
    ChatGPT), the humans providing feedback are inherently biased. Right now, they
    are likely Western English speakers - in fact,
    <a
      href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/08/16/chatgpt-ai-political-bias-research/"
      >we can already see that ChatGPT leans liberal.</a
    >
    Diverse global perspectives are not incorporated into this process. For actual
    human alignment, RLHF needs more representative human feedback, which requires
    giving access to the dataset and the training process to the entire world.
  </p>
  <h3>So, what am I suggesting?</h3>
  <p>
    It is much easier to debunk someone’s ideas than to come up with your own. And
    I must say I am not entirely opposed to Mustafa’s ideas and arguments, as
    already mentioned. Some of them are relevant, and I think he generally has
    good intentions.
  </p>
  <p>
    But, his proposed solutions of increased government regulation and
    closed-source development are fundamentally flawed. As discussed, our current
    governmental institutions are plagued by corruption, partisanship, and
    regulatory capture by special interests. Handing over even more power to
    regulate technology is unlikely to serve the public good. Additionally,
    closed-source development limits transparency stifles innovation, and
    consolidates control in the hands of a few powerful companies. Mustafa’s
    arguments for AI safety research and multipolar AGI also contradict his calls
    for regulation and closed systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rather, we should look to decentralize control and democratize access to
    powerful technologies through open-source development, decentralized
    governance models, and a diverse, multipolar landscape of perspectives and
    values.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Openness:</strong> The world is undoubtedly a complex place.
        Trying to capture and steer it with policymakers and high-profile
        innovators alone is doomed to fail. It is the same as the free markets,
        which work because they are open and free, whereas central planning
        failed, as it is too complex. AI risk containment is similar; it can only
        work in the open, where humanity as a whole works on that together.
        <br /><br />Openness, therefore, stands as a cornerstone of our strategy.
        I encourage any initiative that supports, cultivates, and encourages
        openness in the space of AI research, safety, and alignment - government
        or otherwise. Governments can put more pressure on companies to open
        source their datasets, architectures, and weights so that we, the
        community, can investigate them, find the different pitfalls, stretch
        their limitations, patch the issues, develop safe mechanisms, and build
        tools that help us monitor anomalies in the models; I encourage the
        government to do that in the open, too. As a community, we need to work in
        the open, share our findings and insights, help each other develop tools
        and ways of evaluating dangerous behavior, and monitor progress.
      </p>
      <p></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Open Safety Research:</strong> As mentioned previously in the
        essay, the best way to face the risks is to understand these AI models as
        much as possible. We need to know how they work internally, what different
        neural structures are responsible for what capability, etc. As a
        community, the industry should put more value and attention into AI safety
        and achievements.
        <a href="https://openai.com/blog/bug-bounty-program"
          >OpenAI’s initiative to create bounties for bugs</a
        >
        is a good start, but we should do more: bounties, rewards, grants, etc. We
        should fund and encourage open investigation of AI models. This is
        something that the government can and should incentivize, too.
      </p>
      <p></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Tools:</strong> When it comes to the more urgent issues with AI:
        misinformation, manipulation, deep fake, etc. - I think the only option we
        have to fight it is *more technology*. To have a society where “deep fake
        video” is not an issue, we need to create tools that help individuals
        detect them rather than trying to stop people from creating them. This can
        be achieved, again, by government grants and such - but I also believe it
        will naturally be created even without govs because the need will be
        there, and the free markets will fund it! (Unless, of course, we will be
        regulated from creating the solution to the problem)
      </p>
      <p></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Red Teams:</strong> Here, I am very much aligned with Mustafa. I
        think government-funded red teams will be useful (a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team">red team</a> is a group
        that pretends to be an “enemy” / a malicious actor and tries to “break”
        the AI model to find its flaws). However, their findings must be available
        online for everyone to learn from.
      </p>
      <p></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Some Place for Regulation:</strong> Another interesting point I
        saw recently on Twitter was by Clem, HugginFace’s CEO, where he suggested
        that governments should regulate based on use cases and not based on the
        size of the model and the amount of compute needed (as currently suggested
        by the US):

        This can allow the development of good AI that pushes humanity forward
        while also avoiding potential bad use cases. That being said, transparency
        and open discussion on what these industries are are important.

  <h4>
    And Lastly - A few Words About the e/acc &amp; Techno-Optimism
    Counter-Movement
  </h4>
  <p>
    There is a counter-movement to the established “calling for regulation” AI
    leaders called
    <a
      href="https://effectiveaccelerationism.substack.com/p/repost-effective-accelerationism"
      >e/acc</a
    >
    (Effective Accelerationism) and/or
    <a href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/">Techno-Optimism</a>.
    In short, they’re saying that we must keep pushing (and accelerate) scientific
    research and technological innovation forward as much as possible and that we
    should not hold it by creating a high-regulated environment in order to keep
    civilization flourishing. As you can tell by my essay, this is also my view
    (more or less).
  </p>
  <p>
    However, I disagree with something about this movement, and I felt like I
    should share my perspective here, hoping some of these people will read it.
  </p>
  <p>
    While claiming to advocate for a distributed power and acceleration (as they
    recently have,
    <a href="https://twitter.com/BasedBeffJezos/status/1719008967366488332"
      >calling for an alliance with the crypto community</a
    >), which is indeed a crucial aspect for the positive future of humanity and
    democracy, they are also very much following the problematic aspect of the
    existing establish
    ment by having a
    <a href="https://twitter.com/BasedBeffJezos">leader-first paradigm</a>.
    Founders-centric movement like that tends to concentrate powers, hierarchy,
    and longer-term also unproductive bureaucracy. And it is funny because Marc
    Andreessen, the author of the
    <a href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/">Techno-Optimism</a>
    manifesto, is saying clearly that
    <a href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/"
      >“Our enemy is bureaucracy,</a
    >” - yet he glorifies the “Patron Saints of Techno-Optimism.” - the irony is a
    bit sad, as status games, hierarchy (saints), etc., are what create an
    unproductive bureaucracy!
  </p>
  <p>
    So, for the e/accs people who might read this: While pushing for the
    advancement of civilization, beware of creating the same thing you’re trying
    to replace, if not worse. <strong>The</strong>
    <strong
      >leadership and the powers that drive the movement forward should also be
      decentralized.</strong
